# Introduction

## Goal and target audience

dbt Labs has a thriving OSS community both in users and contributors. This content is aimed at those
within that community who wish to better understand:
- how dbt Labs thinks about OSS
- how to contribute to OSS projects at dbt Labs
- how to better leverage OSS projects at dbt Labs within your own work

If you're familiar with dbt Labs, you'll know that we support several OSS projects.
Our OSS philosophy has evolved over the years, which is reflected in processes and documentation
that have been updated incrementally across these projects.
This resulted in a somewhat inconsistent message and a lot of work on our side to align across projects.
The objective of this project is to centralize those conversations, providing a single, project-agnostic platform
to discuss OSS at dbt Labs.
